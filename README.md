# FICO-Score-Quantization-
This Python script categorizes FICO scores into predefined buckets by calculating the probability of default for each bucket using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The goal is to find the best way to group FICO scores to maximize the predictive accuracy of the model. The script reads a CSV file containing FICO scores and default indicators, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs the optimal boundaries for grouping the FICO scores into categories.
